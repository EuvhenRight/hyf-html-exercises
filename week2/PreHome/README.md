# **git checkout**

\*In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands, itâ€™s a way to work on a particular line of development.

# **git fetch**

\*Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project.

# **git merge**

\*A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. After forking the project history with git branch, git merge lets you put it back together again.
